# Question 3 – validate_results.sh

This script reads student records from marks.txt and checks results based on a passing mark of 33.

After reading each line, the script counts how many subjects a student has failed using conditionals and arithmetic operations.

Students failing in exactly one subject and students passing all subjects are printed separately, along with the total count of each category.
